## Overview

A simple page yet a complex enough layout which made this a wonderful practice project. I made use of HTML 5, CSS & Sass and simple Javascript to build this website.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

## My process

Started with the Mobile-first workflow after which i switched up the flexbox layout and direction within the media screens section in CSS.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com) - CSS extension language


### What I learned

This tested my flexbox knowledge so much, along with positioning and layout changes when the window is switched between dimensions.
